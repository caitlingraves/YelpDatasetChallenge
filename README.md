Yelp Dataset Challenge

The Yelp Dataset Challenge was followed to learn database design and implementation.

Goals achieved:
* Designing and creating a database to hold over 400,000 Yelp reviews, 12,000 businesses, and other business metric data. Database hosted locally using PostgreSQL and PGAdmin.
* Creating SQL queries to filter through the data and find successful and unsuccessful businesses
* Designing and implementing a python application to showcase statistics from the database. Implemented SQL queries in Python to retrieve information to properly search such as allowing a user to choose which state, city, zipcode, and categories they wanted to look at businesses for.
